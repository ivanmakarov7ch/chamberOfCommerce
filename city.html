        Minsk is the administrative capital of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and seat of its
        Executive Secretary. The earliest historical references to Minsk date to the 11th century (1067), when it
        was noted as a provincial city within the Principality of Polotsk. In 1242, Minsk became part of the Grand
        Duchy of Lithuania. It received town privileges in 1499. From 1569, it was a capital of the Minsk
        Voivodeship, in the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was part of a region annexed by the Russian Empire
        in 1793, as a consequence of the Second Partition of Poland. From 1919 to 1991, after the Russian
        Revolution, Minsk was the capital of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union. In
        June 2019, Minsk hosted the 2019 European Games.
